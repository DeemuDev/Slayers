Some instructions before installing:
- Make sure to change the permanent-id you see in the config to another UUID which you can generate @ https://www.guidgenerator.com/ because I'm going to be leaking the UUID already provided soon. (This is for the sake of your own server's safety. If you want to, you can keep the UUID the same)
- Command /slayer menu is not outdated and won't work, instead, you can either use the Maddox batphone (get it using /slayer items) or type /cb (your permanent-id can be found in the config)

FAQ:

Q: What is this?
A: This plugin is essentially something I decided to make out of boredom and it turned out to be fine :D

Q: Please speak english..
A: Well uhm, you have to have some knowledge of plugins before installing this, hehe. (it's not too complicated though!)

Q: Why was the /slayer menu command removed and replaced with a much more complicated system?
A: Simply because, the way the Maddox Batphone in hypixel works, is it gives the player a unique ID each time they call Maddox. And that UUID expires after about 10-15 seconds. I did this because it's a much more efficient system and better for the future! But you can still open the menu using /cb (once again, the permenant-id can be found in your plugin's config file.)

Q: Why is there a permanent ID?
A: Because, if I made a command that opens the menu automatically, there would be no point in using the Batphone, so if you want to make a NPC named Maddox the Slayer, you can just make the player run command /cb , if you change the id in your config, there will mostlikely be no way for your players to find the ID, unless they guess it which is a 1 in a 1,000,000,000,000,000 chance! Because it's a unique ID! It's basically like a "password".
